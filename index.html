				"If you can sustain your interest in what you’re doing, you’re an
				extremely fortunate person. What you see very frequently in people’s
				professional lives, and perhaps in their emotional life as well, is that
				they lose interest in the third act. You sort of get tired, and
				indifferent, and, sometimes, defensive. And you kind of lose your
				capacity for astonishment — and that’s a great loss, because the world
				is a very astonishing place. What I feel fortunate about is that I’m
				still astonished, that things still amaze me. And I think that that’s
				the great benefit of being in the arts, where the possibility for
				learning never disappears, where you basically have to admit you never
				learn it." ―<br />
